Code of Conflict
----------------

The Scato library is a very personal process compared to "traditional" ways of developing software. Your code and ideas behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in critique and criticism. The review will almost always require improvements to the code before it can be included in the library. Know that this happens because everyone involved wants to see the best possible solution for the overall success of purely functional programming in scala. 
This development process has been proven to create robust software, and we do not want to do anything to cause the quality of submission and eventual result to ever decrease.

If however, anyone feels personally abused, threatened, or otherwise uncomfortable due to this process, that is not acceptable. If so, please contact the individual members and they will work to resolve the issue to the best of their ability.

As a reviewer of code, please strive to keep things civil and focused on the technical issues involved.  We are all humans, and frustrations can be high on both sides of the process.
